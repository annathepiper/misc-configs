# Wordpress Dev
This is a small repo where I can put things related to my practice in Wordpress Dev work. What you can find here so far:

## Docker Compose YML File
I'm using Docker to run local Wordpress and MySQL dev images, as well as an instance of PHPMyAdmin. I include my docker-compose.yml here for reference.

## Postman Collection
The file wp-test-demo.postman_collection.json is a Postman collection containing various service endpoints for Wordpress. The collection assumes you've got a local test install of Wordpress using the URL wordpress.local.
